# Cashfree SDK Integration Steps

## Step 1: Add Cashfree maven repository

Add Cashfree maven repository to your module's build.gradle file.

```xml
 repositories { maven { url 'https://maven.cashfree.com/release'} }
 ```

NOTE: We have started distributing our SDK through our private maven repository instead of distributing it through this Github repository.  This repository will be hosting only the sample integration project.

## Step 2: Add Dependency

Open the build.gradle file of your module and add the Cashfree SDK in the dependency section.

For the android support library version, add the following:

```xml
 dependencies { implementation 'com.cashfree.pg:android-support-sdk:1.4.2.2' }
 ```

For the latest androidX library version, add the following:

```xml
 dependencies { implementation 'com.cashfree.pg:android-sdk:1.5.1' }
 ```
<br/>

## Step 3: Add permissions and Dependencies

The CashfreeSDK requires that you add the permissions shown below in your `Android Manifest` file.
We support integration from API level 16. Do ensure that the minSdkVersion in the build.gradle of your app is equal to (or greater than) that.

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<application ...>
```

Add  these dependencies to your build.gradle file.

```xml
dependencies {
    ...
    //Dependencies used by all payment modes
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.1.0'
    implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1'
    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:1.1.3'

    //doPayment - If OTP Auto read enabled (default)
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.1.0'
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:17.0.0'
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth-api-phone:17.3.0'

    //doUPIPayment
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0'

    //doGPayPayment  - Also add the google maven repository as shown in the consecutive step
    implementation files ("libs/google-pay-client-api-1.0.0.aar")
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-tasks:15.0.1'

    //doAmazonPayment
    implementation 'androidx.browser:browser:1.0.0'
}
```

Add the google maven repository to your project in the top level build.gradle only if you are using doGPayPayment() function. The web checkout solution uses collect request which does not need the Google Pay app to be installed in the same phone.


```gradle

    allprojects{
        repositories {
            google()
            ...
        }
    }

```
Set the tools:node attribute to "merge" in the definition of your application element in the Android Manifest file.
If OTP auto-read-submit feature is enabled(by default) for your account add the Google Play services version meta-data.

```xml
<application
        ...
        tools:node="merge">
          <!--Only add it if you need Auto OTP reading feature is enabled-->
        <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
          android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
</application>
```


<br>

## Step 4: Generate Token (From Backend)
You will need to generate a token from your backend and pass it to app while initiating payments. For generating token you need to use our token generation API. Please take care that this API is called only from your <b><u>backend</u></b> as it uses **secretKey**. Thus this API should **never be called from App**.

<br/>

### Request Description

<copybox>

  For production/live usage set the action attribute of the form to:
   `https://api.cashfree.com/api/v2/cftoken/order`

  For testing set the action attribute to:
   `https://test.cashfree.com/api/v2/cftoken/order`

</copybox>

You need to send orderId, orderCurrency and orderAmount as a JSON object to the API endpoint and in response a token will received. Please see  the description of request below.

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
-H 'x-client-id: <YOUR_APP_ID>'
-H 'x-client-secret: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
-d '{
  "orderId": "<ORDER_ID>",
  "orderAmount":<ORDER_AMOUNT>,
  "orderCurrency": "INR"
}' 'https://test.cashfree.com/api/v2/cftoken/order'
```
<br/>

### Request Example

Replace **YOUR_APP_ID** and **YOUR_SECRET_KEY** with actual values.
```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-client-id: YOUR_APP_ID' -H 'x-client-secret: YOUR_SECRET_KEY' -d '{
  "orderId": "Order0001",
  "orderAmount":1,
  "orderCurrency":"INR"
}' 'https://test.cashfree.com/api/v2/cftoken/order'
```
<br/>

### Response Example

```bash
{
"status": "OK",
"message": "Token generated",
"cftoken": "v79JCN4MzUIJiOicGbhJCLiQ1VKJiOiAXe0Jye.s79BTM0AjNwUDN1EjOiAHelJCLiIlTJJiOik3YuVmcyV3QyVGZy9mIsEjOiQnb19WbBJXZkJ3biwiIxADMwIXZkJ3TiojIklkclRmcvJye.K3NKICVS5DcEzXm2VQUO_ZagtWMIKKXzYOqPZ4x0r2P_N3-PRu2mowm-8UXoyqAgsG"
}
```

The "cftoken" is the token that is used authenticate your payment request that will be covered in the next step.
<br/>

## Step 5: Initiate Payment

- App passes the order info and the token to the SDK
- Customer is shown the payment screen where he completes the payment
- Once the payment is complete SDK verifies the payment
- App receives the response from SDK and handles it appropriately


### NOTE

- The order details passed during the token generation and the payment initiation should match. Otherwise you'll get a<b>"invalid order details"</b> error.
- Wrong appId and token will result in <b>"Unable to authenticate merchant"</b> error. The token generated for payment is valid for 5 mins within which the payment has to be initiated. Otherwise you'll get a <b>"Invalid token"</b> error.

# Payment modes


## Web Checkout Integration

### How to integrate


For both the modes (normal and [seamless](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/android/guide/#seamless-integration)) you need to invoke the <b>doPayment()</b> method. However, there are a few extra parameters you need to pass incase of seamless mode.

### getUpiClients

```java

public  String[] getUpiClients(Context context)

```

Get the packages of all the UPI Clients installed on the device as a string array. These packages can then be passed to selectUpiClient() method to initiate payment.



<b>Parameters:</b>



-  <code>context</code>: Context object of the calling activity is required for this method. In most of the cases this will mean sending the instance of the calling activity (this).






## Receive Response



Once the payment is done you will receive the response on the onActivityResult() function inside the invoking activity. In the intent extras you will receive a set of [response parameters](/android/response-param) which you can use to determine if the transaction was successful. Request code will always be equal to CFPaymentService.REQ_CODE.



```java

@Override

protected  void  onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        //Same request code for all payment APIs.
        Log.d(TAG, "ReqCode : " + CFPaymentService.REQ_CODE);
        Log.d(TAG, "API Response : ");
        //Prints all extras. Replace with app logic.
        if (data != null) {
            Bundle  bundle = data.getExtras();
            if (bundle != null)
                for (String  key  :  bundle.keySet()) {
                    if (bundle.getString(key) != null) {
                        Log.d(TAG, key + " : " + bundle.getString(key));
                    }
